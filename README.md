This is a simple program to explore the visualization of fractals. Fractals are geometrics figures where each part of the figure has the same statistical character as the entire figure.

## Getting Started

Run `make`.

Run `./fractal <fractal set>`\
(availble sets: mandelbrot, julia, tricorn, burning ship).
